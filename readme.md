# Project Overview

100% vanilla JS Firefox extension for Discogs.com. Forked from [https://github.com/nebbishOne/discogs-enhancer-firefox](https://github.com/nebbishOne/discogs-enhancer-firefox).

Totally separate project, converting the awesome Firefox extension from that other project into a Firefox extension. Currently, it's not functional.
